# Practical 8
This folder contains the information about the Practical 8

### Problem statement and steps to follow
Write a function that returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a pair of integers passed asarguments. The GCD of two or more non-zero integers, is the largest positive integer that dividesthe numbers without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and12 is 4. A convenient way tofind the GCD of two integers is to use the euclidian algorithm
1. Use the pseudo code to construct an iterative function.
2. Construct a recursive function to do the same, using the formula below the pseudo code

### Compile
* gcc GCD.c -o GCDC

### Execute1
* ./GCDC

### Output1:

Enter two positive integers: 7 69 GCD of 7 and 69 by interactive method is 1 GCD of 7 and 69 by recursive method is 1
